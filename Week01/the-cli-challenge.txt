How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

By adding (.) to to the name of the file or folder. In bash, mv command will rename a file easily.
So, `mv unhidden-file.txt .hidden-file.txt` will do the trick.
The command `ls -a` will display all files including hidden ones. 


How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

A `-p` tag will create parent directories if they don't exit.
`mkdir -p /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are just/for/fun` will do it 

How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:

`echo` will print the new text into the source.
`echo "second message" >> file.txt`
